Changes made to API:

I didn't make any changes to the API


Exercise 1:

I used buckets array to keep track buckets with elements inside. Therefore, it
was easier to implement the histogram method with min/max without any trouble.


Exercise 2:

This method was also pretty straighforward in that I just used mins, maxs maps 
to keep track of min and max for each field in the table. By doing so, I was able 
to create IntHistogram for each integer type fields. I scanned through the entire tuples
in the file twice. First one was to keep track of min and max. Second one was to actually
insert values to the histograms. 

Exercise 3:

I pretty much followed the instruction.


Exercise 4:

Same as the algorithm given. I used PlanCache as our plan storage.

Bonus Points:

Didn't do any of the bonus credits.

Missing Code:

I did everything neccesary for lab 3.

Most Confusing:

TableStats test was bit hard to understand. For example 1.0/32 was hard to understand
and specs for the number of buckets were bit ambiguous. It took me a while to understand
that bucket number should be min of default and max - min + 1.
