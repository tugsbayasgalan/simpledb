I didn't make any significant design decision. I basically just followed the instruction. 

Exercise 1 (copy/paste)

In this part, I had to change a couple of things to pass the subtests. Essentially, I implemented flushAllPages method 
to pass the tests. I also changed markDirty(true, tid) to markDirty(false, tid) to pass the tests. So it was basically just
bunch of small changes inside the bufferpool file.


Exercise 2 (rollback)

This was pretty straightforward as I just followed the instructions

Exercise 3 (recover)

This wasn't that bad either. I pretty much followed the instruction. One problem I noticed was that 
raf was throwing EOF exception, I had to do while(true) until it throws exception and use that exception as a stopping condition
of the while loop. 

Most Confusing Part 

I think this lab was pretty straightforward

Missing Part:

As of now, I am not passing TestCommitAbortCommitCrash. Except for that, everything is working fine.
