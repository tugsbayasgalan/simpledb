Name: Tugsbayasgalan Manlaibaatar

Discussed With: Wei Hou Wu

Time Spent: 20 hours


Design Decision:

There wasn't much to decide as the lab itself was descriptive enough. I just followed
the spec and textbook for the implementation. In some places, it was useful to use reverseIterator
instead of iterator (when we dealing with leftsibling for example). Because the helper methods were
implemented nicely, I didn't have to do decide on lot of things and just went ahead and used existing
helper functions.


Changes Made outside of BTreeFile:

None.


Functionality:

I couldn't make nextkeylocking work properly. Also I couldn't finish BTreeTest.

Bonus Credit:

I tried to implement BTreeReverseScan, but it didn't work out well.


Feedback:

It would be nice if there was more explanation for the test cases so that people
can understand where they are failing. It is really hard to understand BTreeCheck for example.
